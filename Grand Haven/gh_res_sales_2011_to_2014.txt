Striking is a good adjective to describe this 2-story southern charmer which sits prestigiously on a premier lakefront property--impressive even to Grand Haven standards. It's design and appeal is fashioned after the much sought after key west style home. Kissed with southerly characteristics to enjoy such as; front and rear covered porches, upper balcony, plantations shutters, wainscoting, crystal chandeliers,hardwood floors and its sweet interior floor design for that added charm. Keep to its former glory days as a model home, you will enjoy discovering other amenities too. A few to mention: A specially designed A/C system allows independent control for 4-zones; garage, main living quarters and upstairs, beveled front doors, security system, jack & Jill bathroom, upper study,french doors and more.  I particularly enjoy the spacious wood planked back porch that highlights breathtaking the views of the lake and accentuates that southern charm a home of this styling provides.
